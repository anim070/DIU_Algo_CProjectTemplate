# Algorithm Project/Homework submission Code Example/Template (in C)
This code file is for coding style and basic struacture to follow in every submission you made in Algorithm course.
It consists a input file reader and output file writer block, so you don't have to invent the wheel again.
Currently only binary file read and write function is implemented, in future i will add further features as per course mendates.

Now, you have to clone this repo to your own local machine and copy the src/main.c file in your own project.
Every code submission project should consists of following folder/directory structure,
```
/Project_Root_Folder
  /input
    -input.dat
  /output
    -output.dat
  /src
    -main.c (your code resides here)
  /build
   -(All executables and object file should reside here locally, dont add to github repo)
```
